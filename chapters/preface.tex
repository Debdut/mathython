\chapter*{Preface}
Mathython as you guessed means Math + Python. This book guides you through how can you enrich your mathematical creativty with the master tool "Python". This book requires neither previous knowledge of Python nor experience with programming but some experienece with middle school math is expected. The format of this book is almost like story-telling although it covers some serious topics. I earnestly hope that you will enjoy it.
