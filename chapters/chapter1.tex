\chapter{Creating Mathython Evnironment}

In this chapter we will create the {\color{cyan} Mathython}  Environment. I have been using GNU/Linux environment while writing this book
and will assume that you are also running some GNU/Linux distribution or atleast some Unix-type operating system. I hope that
does not deter you from reading this book! {\color{cyan} Don't worry! this chapter includes instructions for setting up GNU/Linux distribution.}
Or if can import my instructions for use in windows, I won't mind. If you are in MacOS, feel happy because you are already
in a Unix-type environment but still there will be some differences.
